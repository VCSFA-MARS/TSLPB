    This example works through the TSLPB EEPROM (memory)
    functions:

      putMemByte()  - write a single byte to the EEPROM
      getMemByte()  - read a single byte from the EEPROM

      writeMemVar() - write your entire variable to the EEPROM
      readMemVar()  - read a value from the EEPROM and store it
                      as the correct type.

  /*
   * In the last example, we wrote data to the EEPROM. But what did it mean?
   * It turns out, those 1s and 0s could mean all kinds of things, depending
   * on how youinterpret them.
   * 
   * For example:
   * 
   *   The hex value 0x65 has the following bit pattern: 01100101
   *   If we treat it as a character, it would be the letter "A"
   *   If we treat it as an integer, it would be the number 101
   *   The way we treat raw data is referred to as the "type" of
   *   the data. 
   *   
   * In this example, we will read the first 4 bytes of the EEPROM
   * and treat them as a floating point (think decimals).

  /*
   * That was easy as pi. Using the "readMemVar()" function lets you
   * automatically translate the raw data to the correct type.
   * 
   * Notice how we created a float called "newFloat"?
   * When we used readMemVar(reg, newFloat) we took the
   * data that started at register reg, interpreted it
   * as a float, and stored the value in newFloat.
   * 
   * This works for all data types defined in Arduino.
   * 
   * What if you want to save your variable without having
   * to translate it into individual bytes? Sounds like a
   * hassle. Does the TSLPB library have a simple function
   * to take care of the dirty work for me?

  /*
   * Why did that come out with nonsense? The library doesn't know where
   * you saved your data in the EEPROM chip, it only knows what type of
   * data you are saving or requesting. 
   *
   * If you give it the wrong starting address, it will read the correct
   * number of bytes and try to interpret them for your variable. 
   * 
   * Now I hear you thinking "ok, not too bad for reading, but what about
   * when I save my variables?"
   *
   * YES! This is important - the library will happily overwrite your data!
   * If you write a floating point (4 bytes long) to register 0, and then
   * write another one starting at register 2, you will clobber half of your
   * data, and there's no way to recover it.
   *
   * It's very important to make sure your data are all stored in registers
   * that don't conflict.
